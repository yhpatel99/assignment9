# Assignment 9 - Data Visualization with Seaborn

## Overview

This assignment is divided into two parts, each focusing on different aspects of data visualization using the Seaborn library in Python. The goal is to create high-quality visualizations that effectively communicate insights from the data.

## Part 1: Exercise Data Analysis

In this part, we analyze the effects of diet and exercise on heart rate using data from `Exercise_Data.csv`. The tasks include:
- Creating a heatmap of pulse data.
- Creating a categorical plot of pulse values by diet and type of exercise.
- Providing conclusions that can be explained to elementary school students.

### Key Visualizations
- **Heatmap of Pulse Data**: Shows the pulse data at 1 minute for different types of exercises.
- **Categorical Plot**: Displays pulse values by diet and type of exercise.

### Conclusions
The visualizations help understand how different diets and exercises affect heart rate, which can be explained to elementary school students.

## Part 2: Planets Dataset Visualization

In this part, we use the built-in `planets` dataset from Seaborn to create various types of plots. The tasks include:
- Creating relational, distributional, and categorical plots.
- Providing a brief explanation of which graphs best demonstrate notable aspects of the data.

### Key Visualizations
- **Scatter Plot of Distance vs Mass**: Highlights the diversity of detection methods and the lack of a clear relationship between distance and mass.
- **Line Plot of Year vs Distance**: Illustrates the evolution of planet discovery over time.
- **Histogram of Planet Mass**: Shows the distribution of planet masses.
- **Box Plot of Mass by Detection Method**: Highlights the spread and outliers of planet masses for each detection method.
- **Bar Plot of Distance by Detection Method**: Indicates the average distance of planets discovered by each method.
- **Count Plot of Detection Methods**: Shows the frequency of each detection method.

### Conclusions
The scatter plot of Distance vs Mass and the line plot of Year vs Distance best demonstrate notable aspects of the data, highlighting the diversity of detection methods and the evolution of planet discovery over time.
